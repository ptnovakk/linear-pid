# linear-pid
This repository is for experimenting with a linear PID controller used to balance a rolling ball on a small tilted rail.

What's new (visual refresh)
 - Gradient background (black -> dark green)
 - Lime-green, slightly 3D sliders
 - Glowing lime rail
 - Shaded, realistic red ball with shadow and highlight

Run
	python linear-pid-sim.py

The simulation opens an interactive Matplotlib window with live sliders for Setpoint / Kp / Ki / Kd.
